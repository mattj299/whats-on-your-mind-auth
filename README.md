# Watch it live

Watch the code live [here!](https://whats-on-your-mind-auth.netlify.app/)

## Project idea

Users can share what they're thinking and either remain anonymous or share there name.
Meant to be a friendly zone so people can simply write out what they're thinking.
People can just share there thoughts for example if they need to let something out they can, just type it here.

## Make it work in localhost

In order to make the code work do the following:
Open two separate command lines. cd inside client and server folder
run "npm install" in your command line for both folders
create a .env file and use the .env.example in the repo to create your own .env (common error is mongodb, include 0.0.0.0/0 in your IP ADDRESS'S as well as include your own ip address)
run "npm start" in both files
At this point code should be up and running :)

<!-- fixed loading screens to display "loading..." when loading posts and "No posts here..." when there are no posts posted -->
<!-- add little information to the sign up to display to user to make sure to remember there password as it cannot be recovered -->
